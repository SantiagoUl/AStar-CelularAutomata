            <p>  Conway's Game of Life is a popular cellular automaton simulation developed by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
                Game of life is a zero-player game and therefore its evolution is determined by its initial state not needing any further input from the user. 
                This game consists of grids of hundreds of cells that can only be in two states: "alive" or "dead". Their status is determined by a set of rules
                that goes as it follows: 
                1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
                2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
                3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
                4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
                   At each iteration of the game, state of cells changes based on their current state and that of their neighbors.
                Eventhough there are only four simple rules, they lead to a wide range of complex and beautiful patterns and behaviors, some of which are
                still being studied to this day. The Game of Life has been used as a tool for exploring computational complexity and the limits of computation, 
                and it has been used for artistic and creative purposes too for creating designs and patterns that are inspired by the principles of computation 
                and information theory.</p>
